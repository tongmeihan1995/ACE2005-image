# Description
We manually recover illustrations of news articles in ACE2005 from the original website and other websites that describe the same event. The 'same event' is defined as the events sharing the same event arguments: subject, object, and place. For instance, 'Wildfires Rip Through Southern California' is the same event as 'Massive wildfires rage in California', since they both report a fire event and share the same event arguments: Massive wildfires and California.
